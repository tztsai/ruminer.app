*September 15, 2025*

## Scope

These terms govern your use of the Ruminer mobile and desktop applications (the "App"), the Ruminer website, and any related services (collectively, the "Service").

## Important Terms

These terms include a number of especially important provisions that affect your rights and responsibilities, such as the disclaimers in Disclaimers, limits on the operator's legal liability to you in Limits on Liability, your agreement to reimburse the operator for problems caused by your misuse of the Service in Your Responsibility, and an agreement about how to resolve disputes in Disputes.

### Your Permission to Use the Service

Subject to these terms, the operator gives you permission to use the Service. You can't transfer your permission to anyone else. Others need to agree to these terms for themselves to use the Service.

### Conditions for Use of the Service

Your permission to use the Service is subject to the following conditions:

- You may not automate access to the Service, or monitor the Service, such as with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer program that is not a web browser. You may crawl the Service to index it for a publicly available search engine, so long as you abide by the rules of any robots.txt file on the Service.

- You may not impersonate others through the Service.
- You may not encourage or help anyone in violation of these terms.

### Content Standards

- You may not use the Service to process content as a mere placeholder to hold a particular address, user name, or other unique identifier.
- You may not use the Service to disclose information from or about others that you don't have the right to disclose.

### Enforcement

The operator may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent. The operator may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.

The operator reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the Service for any reason. If you believe someone has used the Service in violation of these terms, contact the operator immediately. See Contact.

### Your Account

You must create and log into an account to use some features of the Service.

To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close your account at any time.

You agree to be responsible for everything done with your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the operator that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify the operator immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised. You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.

The operator may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the Service according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the operator reasonably believes that you've breached these terms.

### Your Content

You retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in the content you process with the Service, including images and any text extracted from them ("Your Content").

To provide the Service, you grant the operator a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, store, and process Your Content. This license is solely for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service for you. This includes syncing your content across your devices and using it to provide you with search results and other features. Your Content will not be shared with other users.

Some features of the Service may use third-party AI providers. To use these features, you may need to send Your Content to these providers. By using AI-powered features, you agree that your data may be processed by these third parties, subject to their own terms and privacy policies. The operator is not responsible for the practices of third-party providers.

The operator does not take responsibility for storing or backing up Your Content. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups.

### Your Responsibility

You agree to reimburse the operator for all the costs of legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account. Both you and the operator agree to notify the other side of any legal claims you might have to reimburse the operator for as soon as possible. If the operator fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won't have to reimburse the operator for costs that you could have defended against or lessened with prompt notice. You agree to allow the operator to take over investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the operator for, and to cooperate with those efforts. The operator agrees not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires you to do anything without your permission.

### Fees and Payment

Some features of the Service are free to use, while others require a paid subscription ("Paid Services").

**Subscriptions.** Paid Services are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the subscription plan you select. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel it.

**Fee Changes.** The operator, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.

**Refunds.** Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.

### Disclaimers

You accept all risk of using the Service and its content. As far as the law allows, the operator provides the Service and its content as is, without any warranty whatsoever.

The Service may use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide certain features. The output from these features may be inaccurate, incomplete, or offensive. You should independently verify any information you receive from the Service before relying on it. The operator makes no warranties about the quality, accuracy, or reliability of AI-generated content.

The Service may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by others. The operator does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide. Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.

### Limits on Liability

The operator will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages operator personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.

As far as the law allows, the operator's total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the Service or its content will be limited to $50.

### Feedback

The operator welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the Service. See Contact.

You agree that the operator will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the operator won't have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you for it. You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.

### Termination

Either you or the operator may end this agreement at any time. When this agreement ends, your permission to use the Service also ends.

The following sections continue after this agreement ends: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.

### Disputes

The governing law will govern these terms and all legal proceedings related to these terms or your use of the Service. If the operator doesn't say what the governing law is, it's the law under which the operator's legal entity is formed. If the operator doesn't have a legal entity, it's the law of the state where the operator is based.

Both sides agree to bring legal any proceedings related to this agreement only in the national and any national-subdivision courts located in the forum for disputes. If the operator doesn't say what the forum for disputes is, it's the city with state and federal courts in the state of the governing law that is closest to where the operator is based. If the operator isn't based in that state, the forum for disputes is the capital of that state.

Neither you nor the operator will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.

If the governing law allows, both sides waive their rights to trial by jury.

Both sides agree to bring any legal claims related to this agreement as individuals, not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding.

## General Terms

If a section of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that section should be changed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that section should be removed, and the others should be enforced as written.

You may not assign this agreement. The operator may assign this agreement to any affiliate of the operator, any other company that obtains control of the operator, or any other company that buys assets of the operator related to the Service. Any attempt to assign against these terms has no legal effect.

Neither the exercise of any right under this agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this agreement, waives any other breach of this agreement.

These terms, plus the terms on any page incorporating them by reference, are all the terms of agreement between you and the operator about use of the Service. This agreement entirely replaces any other agreements about your use of the Service, written or not.

### Contact

You may notify the operator under these terms, and send questions to the operator, using the contact information they provide.

The operator may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the Service, or by posting a message to the homepage of the Service or your account page.

### Changes

The operator may update the terms of service for the Service. The operator will post all updates to the Service. For updates with substantial changes, the operator agrees to e-mail you if you've created an account and provided a valid e-mail address. The operator may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the Service.

Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the Service.
