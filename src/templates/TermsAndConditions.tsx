      <StyledText style="body">
        The operator reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on

      </StyledText>

      <StyledText style="body">
        Between you and the operator, you remain solely responsible for content
        you submit to the website. You agree not to wrongly imply that content
        you submit to the website is from, sponsored by, or approved by the
        operator. These terms do not obligate the operator to store, maintain,
        or provide copies of content you submit.
      </StyledText>

      <StyledText style="body">
        Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide how to
        license it to others. But at a minimum, you license the operator to
        provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the
        website. That special license allows the operator to copy, publish, and
        analyze content you submit to the website.
      </StyledText>

      <StyledText style="body">
        When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or
        by the operator, the operator’s special license ends when the last copy
        disappears from the operator’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other
        licenses you give for your content may continue after your content is
        removed. Those licenses may give others, or the operator itself, the
        right to share your content through the website again.
      </StyledText>

      <StyledText style="body">
        Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the
        terms on which you license your content. You agree that the operator
        will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

        by others using your account. Both you and the operator agree to notify
        the other side of any legal claims you might have to reimburse the
        operator for as soon as possible. If the operator fails to notify you of
        a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to reimburse the operator for
        costs that you could have defended against or lessened with prompt
        notice. You agree to allow the operator to take over investigation,
        defense, and settlement of legal claims you would have to reimburse the
        operator for, and to cooperate with those efforts. The operator agrees
        not to enter any settlement that admits you were at fault or requires
        you to do anything without your permission.

        The governing law will govern these terms and all legal proceedings
        related to these terms or your use of the website. If the operator
        doesn’t say what the governing law is, it’s the law under which the

        forum for disputes is, it’s the city with state and federal courts in
        the state of the governing law that is closest to where the operator is
        based. If the operator isn’t based in that state, the forum for disputes
        is the capital of that state.
