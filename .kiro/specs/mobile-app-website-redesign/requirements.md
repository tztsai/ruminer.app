# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves redesigning the Ruminer website to focus specifically on the mobile app rather than a multi-platform system. The current website presents Ruminer as a comprehensive platform with web, desktop, and mobile applications, but we need to pivot to showcase only the mobile app experience. The redesigned website should effectively communicate the mobile app's value proposition, features, and benefits while maintaining the existing design system and user experience patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential mobile app user, I want to understand what the Ruminer mobile app does, so that I can decide if it meets my content management needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a clear hero section that describes Ruminer as a mobile app for content management
2. WHEN a user reads the main value proposition THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile-specific benefits like "organize content on-the-go" and "AI-powered search in your pocket"
3. WHEN a user views feature descriptions THEN the system SHALL focus on mobile use cases and scenarios
4. IF a user is looking for platform information THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this is a mobile app (iOS/Android)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to see features that are relevant to mobile usage, so that I understand how the app will work on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the features section THEN the system SHALL highlight mobile-optimized capabilities like offline search, touch-friendly interface, and mobile integrations
2. WHEN describing AI features THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile contexts like "snap a photo and get instant AI labels" or "search your content while commuting"
3. WHEN showing search capabilities THEN the system SHALL focus on mobile search patterns and quick access features
4. IF mentioning technical aspects THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile-first architecture and offline capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor interested in downloading the app, I want clear calls-to-action for mobile app stores, so that I can easily install the Ruminer app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to download the app THEN the system SHALL display prominent app store badges (iOS App Store, Google Play Store)
2. WHEN a user clicks on app store links THEN the system SHALL direct them to the appropriate mobile app store
3. WHEN viewing the CTA sections THEN the system SHALL use mobile-focused language like "Download the App" instead of "Get Started"
4. IF a user is on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL prioritize the relevant app store link based on their platform

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator or professional, I want to understand how the mobile app fits into my workflow, so that I can see its practical value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads use case examples THEN the system SHALL present mobile-centric scenarios like capturing content during meetings, organizing photos while traveling, or searching documents during commutes
2. WHEN viewing the problem/solution sections THEN the system SHALL address mobile-specific pain points like "scattered content across phone apps" or "difficulty finding files on mobile"
3. WHEN reading about integrations THEN the system SHALL focus on mobile app integrations and mobile-friendly workflows
4. IF describing the target audience THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile professionals and on-the-go content creators

2. WHEN reading about technical capabilities THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile-specific technical benefits like local SQLite storage, efficient sync, and mobile-optimized search
3. WHEN viewing social proof or testimonials THEN the system SHALL focus on mobile app user experiences and mobile use cases
4. IF comparing with competitors THEN the system SHALL emphasize mobile app strengths over web-based or desktop solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the existing design and user experience to remain consistent, so that the site feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing design system, components, and styling
2. WHEN users navigate the site THEN the system SHALL preserve the current layout structure, navigation patterns, and responsive behavior
3. WHEN viewing updated content THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing tone, voice, and brand personality while adapting messaging for mobile focus
